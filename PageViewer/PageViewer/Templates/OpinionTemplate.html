In a rare demonstration of candid talk, Cardinal Merry Rant said that the church reprimanded him for speaking his mind in a recent pub crawl. 'I couldn't really help it, could I? I was sitting around with the other lads, having a few jars, when we started to talk about the crazy things which are known to happen in the vatican. So I told then about the time that O'Malley brought a dog in and hid it under the pulpit during a public cermon. Whenever it barked O'Malley pretended to cough, so no one would notice."
